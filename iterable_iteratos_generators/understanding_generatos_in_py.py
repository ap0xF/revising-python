"""
Generator functions are special types of functions that allow you to create iterators using a functional style.
Unlike regular functions, which typically compute a value and return it to the caller,
generator functions return a generator iterator that yields a stream of data one value at a time.
"""

"""
Note: In Python, youâ€™ll commonly use the term generators to collectively refer to two separate concepts: 
the generator function and the generator iterator. The generator function is the function that you define using the yield statement.
The generator iterator is what this function returns.
"""

"""
A generator function returns an iterator (generator iterator) that supports the iterator protocol out of the box. 
So, generators are also iterators.
